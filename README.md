# hexedit

**hexedit** is a command-line tool for modifying the content of a binary file by replacing a portion of the file starting at a given position with a specified hexadecimal string. The program preserves the original file's access and modification times.

## Usage

### Parameters:
- **-pos X**: Starting position in the file (in bytes) for the modification.

- **-r SOURCE_FILE**: Path to the source file.
- **-o OUTPUT_FILE**: Path to the output file.

### Example:

This example writes the binary value `0xDEADBEEF` to `input.bin` starting at byte 10 and saves the result to `output.bin`.

## Features
- Supports up to 1000-character hexadecimal data input.
- Preserves the original fileâ€™s access and modification timestamps.
- Secure handling: sensitive data is cleared from memory after processing.
